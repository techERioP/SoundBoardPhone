# SoundBoardPhone
A program to use your phone as a SoundBoard for your pc:
This program is made by me (not a good programmer) LITERALLY copying this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbfe3-v7yE0) and using [Tkinter-Designer](https://github.com/ParthJadhav/Tkinter-Designer) so don't exepct support because i don't even know very well english.
# Installation:
Download the serverphonegui and the clientpc, for the serverphonegui i tried only with [pydroid3](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.iiec.pydroid3&hl=en_US&gl=US&pli=1) and it works, you just copy the serverphonegui
to your android device run the gui.py. For the clientpc just run the .bat.
